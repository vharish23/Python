This project is about predicting chronic kidney disease of patients obtained from a University of Virginia "case study".
I completed this interesting project as part of my Grad school coursework, Health Information Management & Analytics (IDS-594) at UIC.

Overview of dataset:
Number of independent variables - 33
Number of dependent / Target variable - 1 (Predicted as CKD)

Observations in known data - 6000
Observations in unknown data - 2819
